This project uses machine learning and statistical modeling to evaluate and predict MLB player contract terms — specifically contract length, total value, and average annual value (AAV) — based on historical performance, accolades, and public presence metrics (e.g., social media following).

The goal is to identify overvalued, undervalued, and fair value contracts using interpretable models and apply them to upcoming free agents.

Techniques used:

Linear regression & Lasso regression

XGBoost (with cross-validation)

Feature selection & multivariate modeling

Residual analysis for contract valuation classification

The repo includes code for:

Data preparation and feature engineering

Model training and evaluation (train/test split)

Visualizations including actual vs. predicted values and player-level annotations
